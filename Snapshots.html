            This was our first gantt chart. It started in the second week of the project and ended once we had our client meeting.
            We felt this was a good time frame as this was our first big milestone, and we had to complete user requirements 
            and questions beforehand. This plan was achievable and we most of the deliverables seen. We did not start the risk register
            as we had not thought much about 
            However, looking back on our process, it would have been beneficial to create this plan earlier as we made it mid-week.

            This week we decided it was more beneficial to make a full representation of our full project in our gantt chart.
            This plan is likely to change as we are unsure of times and completion dates. We have included some dependencies, 
            i.e. we cannot start the implementation without the architectural diagrams. Not all tasks have been assigned 
            to a team member as of yet as the tasks have not been fully broken down. This week we made this plan quickly which
            was very beneficial. However, we need the plan to be more detailed.
